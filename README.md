### Requirements

- Bash (version 4.0 or later)
- curl

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script:

- `git clone https://github.com/JeninSutradhar/CVE-2024-4577-checker.git`
- `cd cve-2024-4577-checker`

2. Make the script executable:

- `chmod +x cve_2024_4577_checker.sh`

## Usage

### Basic Usage 
`./cve_2024_4577_checker.sh -f domains.txt`
- This will scan all domains listed in the domains.txt file.

### Options

- `-f` file: Specify a file containing a list of domains to check (one domain per line)
- `-t` threads: Set the number of concurrent threads (default: 10)
- `-u` user_agent: Set a custom User-Agent string
- `-i`: Run in interactive mode, allowing manual input of domains
- `-h`: Display the help message

### Output

- **At the end of the scan, a summary is displayed showing:**

1. Total number of scanned domains
2. Number of vulnerable domains
3. Number of safe domains
4. Number of domains that timed out

- **Additionally, two files are generated:**

1. A detailed log file (vulnerability_scan_[timestamp].log)
2. An HTML report (vulnerability_report_[timestamp].html)

## Examples

1. Scan domains from a file:

- `./cve_2024_4577_checker.sh -f domains.txt`

2. Scan domains with increased concurrency:

- `./cve_2024_4577_checker.sh -f domains.txt -t 20`

3. Use a Custom User-Agent:

- `./cve_2024_4577_checker.sh -f domains.txt -u "MyCustomUserAgent/1.0"`

4. Run in interactive mode:

- `./cve_2024_4577_checker.sh -i`
